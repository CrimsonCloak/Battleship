# Battleship

This is a game I'm making from scratch, inspired by/eventually will be like the (board) game battleship.

## Usage

There is an active deployed GitHub-page if you want to try out this very basic game. Another option is to use my personal Docker image, which will deploy a basic webserver that serves this game over HTTP.
Feel free to use the docker-compose file located in this GitHub for a quicker setup.
